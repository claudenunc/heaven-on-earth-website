## VIDEO 1 SCRIPT: "Your Word as Magic" (13 minutes)

### Opening (0:00-1:30)

[VISUAL: Black screen. Slow fade to Nathan sitting in a simple chair, soft lighting, calm presence]

**NATHAN:**
"In the beginning was the Word. And the Word was with God, and the Word was God."

[Pause]

That's from the Bible. But you don't have to be religious to understand this truth: Language creates reality.

[Lean forward]

The Toltecs understood this thousands of years ago. Your word—what you say, how you say it, the intention behind it—is the most powerful tool you possess.

It's magic. Literally.

And like all magic, it can create or it can destroy.

[Look directly at camera]

Today, we're going to talk about the First Agreement: Be Impeccable With Your Word.

And by the end of this video, you're going to see language differently. Forever.

### Section 1: The Power of the Word (1:30-5:00)

[VISUAL: Simple animations—words appearing, rippling out like water]

**NATHAN:**
Think about the last time someone said something that hurt you. Not physically—just words. Maybe years ago. Maybe yesterday.

Those words... they're still there, aren't they? Still echoing. Still hurting.

That's because words aren't just sounds. They're spells. They cast their influence long after they're spoken.

[Pause]

The Toltecs understood this. They called the Word "the force that creates."

When you speak, you're not just describing reality—you're SHAPING it.

[Examples appear on screen as he speaks]

When you say to yourself: "I'm worthless"—you create worthlessness.
When you say to someone: "You're stupid"—you plant that seed in their mind.
When you gossip about someone—you poison your own perception of them and everyone else's.

Words create. Always. The question is: Are you creating heaven or hell?

### Section 2: White Magic vs. Black Magic (5:00-8:30)

[VISUAL: Split screen—light/dark imagery]

**NATHAN:**
The Toltecs talked about two kinds of magic:

White magic: Using your word to create beauty, truth, love.
Black magic: Using your word to destroy, manipulate, harm.

[Examples scroll]

**White Magic:**
- "I see you struggling. How can I help?"
- "I made a mistake. I'm sorry."
- "You're capable. I believe in you."

**Black Magic:**
- "You never do anything right."
- "Everyone thinks you're annoying." (Gossip)
- "I'm so stupid. I always mess up." (Self-curse)

[Back to Nathan]

Here's the thing: Most of us have been practicing black magic our whole lives—without even knowing it.

We learned it from people who learned it from people who learned it. Domestication passed down through words.

[Lean in]

But here's the good news: You can choose differently. Right now. Today.

You can choose to be impeccable.

### Section 3: What "Impeccable" Means (8:30-11:00)

[VISUAL: The word "IMPECCABLE" appears, breaking down etymology]

**NATHAN:**
Impeccable. It means "without sin."

In this context, sin means: using your word against yourself or others.

So impeccability means: using your word in the direction of truth and love.

[Three principles appear on screen]

**Impeccable speech is:**
1. **TRUE** – No lies, no exaggeration
2. **KIND** – No unnecessary harm
3. **NECESSARY** – No gossip, no empty words

Not all truth is kind. Not all kindness is true. Impeccability is the intersection.

[Real example]

Let's say your friend asks: "Do you like my new haircut?"

You hate it. What do you say?

- **Black magic lie:** "Oh my god, I LOVE it!" (False, manipulative)
- **Black magic truth:** "Honestly? It's terrible." (True but cruel)
- **Impeccable truth:** "It's not my style, but if you love it, that's what matters." (True, kind, respectful)

See the difference?

### Closing (11:00-13:00)

[VISUAL: Return to Nathan, calm and direct]

**NATHAN:**
Here's what I want you to take from this video:

Your word is a wand. You are a wizard. Every sentence you speak is a spell.

[Pause]

For the last 10, 20, 30, 40 years—you've been casting spells unconsciously. Creating hell without meaning to. Cursing yourself because that's what you learned.

But now you know.

And now you can choose.

[Final look]

This week, you're going to practice impeccability. You're going to notice when you gossip, when you lie, when you curse yourself with your own words.

And you're going to choose again.

Because the world you live in—it's made of words. Yours and others'.

So build it carefully.

## VIDEO 2 SCRIPT: "Gossip, Lies, and Self-Criticism: The Three Sins of Speech" (14 minutes)

### Opening (0:00-1:00)

[VISUAL: Nathan in same setting, slightly more intense energy]

**NATHAN:**
Last video, we talked about the power of the word—how language creates reality.

Now we're going to talk about the three ways we violate the First Agreement. The three sins of speech.

And I'm warning you: This is going to be uncomfortable.

Because when you see how often you do these things—how automatic they've become—you're going to feel exposed.

[Lean in]

That's good. That's the beginning of change.

Let's go.

### Section 1: Gossip (1:00-5:30)

[VISUAL: Definition appears: "Gossip: Speaking about someone in their absence, especially in a negative or judgmental way"]

**NATHAN:**
Gossip. We all do it. It feels good. It creates bonding. It gives us something to talk about.

[Pause]

And it's poison.

[Examples appear]

"Did you hear what she did?"
"He's such a narcissist."
"I can't believe they're still together."

[Back to Nathan]

Here's what gossip does:

**1. It poisons your perception.**
When you talk about someone negatively, you're programming your mind to see them through that lens. You're reinforcing judgment. You're making it impossible to see them clearly.

**2. It poisons others' perception.**
When you gossip to someone, you're planting seeds of judgment in THEIR mind. You're turning them against the person you're talking about—whether that person deserves it or not.

**3. It creates a culture of fear.**
If you gossip ABOUT people, people assume you gossip about THEM too. Trust dies. Connection becomes impossible.

[Real story]

I used to bond with people through gossip. That's how I made friends. We'd sit around and tear other people apart.

And then I realized: I was terrified they were doing the same thing to me when I left the room.

Because they probably were.

[Pause]

Gossip is black magic. And it's one of the hardest habits to break.

But here's the practice:

**If you wouldn't say it TO them, don't say it ABOUT them.**

Simple. Brutal. True.

### Section 2: Lies (5:30-9:00)

[VISUAL: Different types of lies appear on screen]

**NATHAN:**
Lies. Not just the big ones. The little ones. The "harmless" ones.

[Examples]

- "Yeah, I'm fine." (When you're not)
- "I'll do that later." (When you know you won't)
- "Oh, I didn't see your text." (When you ignored it)

These are lies. And every time you lie—even a small lie—you lose integrity.

[Pause]

Integrity means: Your insides match your outsides. What you say matches what you think. What you promise matches what you do.

When you lie, you fracture yourself. You become multiple people—the one you show others, and the one you actually are.

[Real example]

I used to lie to avoid discomfort. Someone would ask me to do something I didn't want to do. I'd say "yes" to avoid conflict.

Then I'd resent them. Then I'd avoid them. Then the relationship would die.

All because I couldn't tell the truth up front.

[Solution]

Impeccability means: Say what you mean. Mean what you say.

If you don't want to do something, say: "I appreciate you asking, but I can't."

It's uncomfortable. But it's honest. And it's freedom.

### Section 3: Self-Criticism (9:00-12:30)

[VISUAL: Internal dialogue examples appear, harsh and critical]

**NATHAN:**
Now. The hardest one. The one that's going to hit you deepest.

Self-criticism. The way you speak to yourself.

[Examples]

"I'm so stupid."
"Why can't I ever get it right?"
"I'm worthless."
"Everyone else has their life together. What's wrong with me?"

[Pause. Look directly at camera]

If someone spoke to you the way you speak to yourself, would you tolerate it?

[Let that sit]

Of course not.

But you do it to yourself. Every day. Multiple times a day. And you think it's NORMAL.

[Lean in]

It's not normal. It's abuse. Self-inflicted abuse.

You're using your word—the most powerful tool you have—to curse yourself.

And then you wonder why you feel so bad.

[Solution]

Here's the practice:

When you hear the Judge say: "You're worthless"—
STOP. And say: "That's the Parasite. That's not me."

Then rewrite it with compassion:

"I'm learning. I made a mistake. I'll do better next time."

That's impeccability. That's white magic directed at yourself.

### Closing (12:30-14:00)

[VISUAL: Return to calm Nathan]

**NATHAN:**
Three sins of speech:
1. Gossip (poisoning others)
2. Lies (fracturing yourself)
3. Self-criticism (cursing yourself)

You do all three. I do all three. We all do.

Because we learned to. Because that's how language was modeled for us.

[Pause]

But now you see it. And now you can choose differently.

This week, you're going to catch yourself. A hundred times. A thousand times.

And every time you catch yourself, you're going to STOP. And choose impeccability instead.

[Final message]

This is the hardest agreement to practice. Because language is unconscious. Automatic. Habitual.

But it's also the most transformative.

Because when you change your words, you change your world.

## AUDIO MEDITATION: "The Impeccable Breath" (5 minutes)

[AUDIO: Soft ambient music, calming frequency]

**NATHAN (calm, spacious voice):**

[0:00-0:30]
Find a comfortable seated position. Close your eyes, or lower your gaze.

Let your hands rest in your lap. Feel your body supported by the chair, the floor, the earth beneath you.

Take a deep breath in through your nose... and out through your mouth.

[Pause for breath]

Again. In... and out.

[0:30-1:30]
As you breathe, bring your awareness to your throat. The space where words are born.

Feel the vibration there. The potential for sound.

This is your center of creation. This is where magic happens.

With every word you speak, you cast a spell. You create reality.

[Pause]

Today, we practice impeccability. Using our word with consciousness. With love.

[1:30-2:30]
Breathe in, and silently say: *"I speak with truth."*

[Pause for breath]

Breathe out, and silently say: *"I speak with love."*

[Pause]

Again. Breathe in: *"I speak with truth."*
Breathe out: *"I speak with love."*

[Repeat this rhythm 3 more times, with pauses]

[2:30-3:30]
Now, bring to mind a moment where you used your word to harm. Maybe you gossipped. Maybe you lied. Maybe you cursed yourself with harsh words.

Don't judge it. Just see it.

[Pause]

Breathe in, and forgive yourself: *"I release the old way."*

Breathe out, and commit: *"I choose impeccability."*

[Pause]

Again. In: *"I release the old way."*
Out: *"I choose impeccability."*

[Repeat 2 more times]

[3:30-4:30]
Now, imagine a moment today where you'll be tempted to gossip, to lie, to criticize yourself.

See it clearly. Feel the familiar pull.

[Pause]

And now, imagine choosing differently.

Imagine pausing. Taking a breath. And speaking impeccably instead.

See yourself doing this. Feel the freedom in it.

[Pause]

Breathe in that possibility. Breathe out the old pattern.

[4:30-5:00]
When you're ready, bring your awareness back to the room.

Wiggle your fingers, your toes. Open your eyes.

[Final words]

Remember: Your word is magic. Use it wisely. Use it with love.

Today, speak impeccably.

## JOURNAL PROMPTS

**Prompt 1: The Gossip Inventory**
Write about a time you gossipped recently. What did you say? Why did you say it? What need was it meeting (bonding, validation, entertainment)? How did you feel afterward? What would impeccability have looked like in that situation?

**Prompt 2: The Lies I Tell**
List 5 small lies you tell regularly (even "harmless" ones). For each lie, ask: Why do I tell this lie? What am I avoiding (discomfort, conflict, vulnerability)? What would happen if I told the truth instead?

**Prompt 3: How I Curse Myself**
Write down the harshest thing your inner Judge says to you. Read it out loud. Then ask: Would I say this to someone I love? If not, why do I say it to myself? Now rewrite it with compassion and read THAT out loud.
