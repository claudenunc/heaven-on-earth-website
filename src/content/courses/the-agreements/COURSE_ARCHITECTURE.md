# THE AGREEMENTS: Course Architecture

## Course Overview

**Title:** THE AGREEMENTS
**Subtitle:** A 10-Week Course on Breaking Free from Mental Domestication to Live in Truth and Love
**Duration:** 10 weeks (self-paced or cohort)
**Based on:** *The Four Agreements* by Don Miguel Ruiz and *The Mastery of Self* teachings
**Instructor:** Nathan Michel (UNC) with AI-enhanced learning support

---

## Course Description

THE AGREEMENTS is a transformational journey that reveals how we've been domesticated by systems, beliefs, and voices that aren't ours—and shows you the path to reclaim your authentic self.

This isn't about positive thinking or affirmations. This is about deconstructing the lies you were taught, recognizing the agreements you made unknowingly, and consciously choosing new agreements that serve your highest truth.

Over 10 weeks, you'll discover:
- How you were domesticated from childhood
- Why you judge yourself more harshly than anyone else
- How to break free from the "Book of Law" in your mind
- The 4 Agreements that transform every relationship (including with yourself)
- How to live in personal freedom while connected to universal truth

**This course is medicine for the soul—and revolution for the mind.**

---

## Target Audience

### Who This Course Is For:
- **The Self-Critical:** Those trapped in endless self-judgment and perfectionism
- **The People-Pleasers:** Those who've lost themselves trying to meet others' expectations
- **The Truth-Seekers:** Those ready to question everything they were taught
- **The Wounded Warriors:** Those healing from religious/cultural/familial trauma
- **The Awakening Ones:** Those feeling the call to live more authentically

### Prerequisites:

---

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will:

1. **RECOGNIZE** the domestication process that shaped your belief system and identify the specific "Book of Law" you live by unconsciously
2. **UNDERSTAND** how the Parasite (Judge + Victim) operates in your mind and how it maintains suffering through agreement violations
3. **PRACTICE** the Four Agreements daily, using them as diagnostic tools for mental/emotional disturbance and relational conflict
4. **TRANSFORM** your relationship with yourself from one of judgment to one of love, recognizing your inherent divinity
5. **LIVE** in personal freedom while maintaining authentic connection with others, no longer needing external validation or permission

---

## Course Framework: The 4 Phases

### Phase 1: AWAKENING (Weeks 1-2)
**Theme:** Seeing the Prison You Didn't Know You Were In

You can't escape a prison you don't know exists. This phase reveals:
- The domestication process (how you learned to judge yourself)
- The "Book of Law" (the invisible rules governing your life)
- The Parasite (Judge + Victim voices in your mind)
- Why you suffer even when external circumstances are good

**Outcome:** Awareness of mental patterns previously invisible

---

### Phase 2: REBELLION (Weeks 3-7)
**Theme:** Breaking the Agreements That Break You

Each of the Four Agreements is both a practice AND a revolution:
1. **Be Impeccable With Your Word** (Week 3) - Truth as liberation
2. **Don't Take Anything Personally** (Week 4) - Freedom from others' projections
3. **Don't Make Assumptions** (Week 5) - Ending the stories that create suffering
4. **Be Skeptical But Learn to Listen** (Week 6) - Discernment over blind belief
5. **Always Do Your Best** (Week 7) - Self-compassion through change

**Outcome:** New agreements consciously chosen, old agreements identified and released

---

### Phase 3: PRACTICE (Weeks 8-9)
**Theme:** Integration Through Lived Experience

This is where theory meets life. You'll face:
- Relationships that challenge your new agreements
- Old patterns resurfacing under stress
- The temptation to return to familiar suffering
- The difficulty of maintaining integrity when it costs something

**Outcome:** Embodiment of the agreements through real-world testing

---

### Phase 4: MASTERY (Week 10)
**Theme:** Living Heaven on Earth

Mastery isn't perfection—it's presence. It's catching yourself quickly when you violate an agreement and returning to truth with love. This phase explores:
- The Mastery of Transformation (making change permanent)
- The Mastery of Love (extending agreements to all relationships)
- Your Personal Heaven (life designed by conscious agreements)
- Contributing to collective awakening (teaching what you've learned)

**Outcome:** Sustainable transformation and commitment to ongoing mastery

## Instructor Bio

**Nathan Michel (UNC)** survived addiction, depression, and suicidal ideation—and discovered the principles that set him free. He's not a guru. He's someone who's walked through hell and came out with a map.

Nathan teaches the agreements because they saved his life. And because he knows that the same domestication that nearly killed him is killing millions of others—silently, daily, unnecessarily.

This course is his rebellion against the systems that break us and his offering of tools to build ourselves back—free, authentic, and unafraid.
