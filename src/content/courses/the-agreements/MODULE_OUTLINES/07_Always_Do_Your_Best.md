# Module 7: Always Do Your Best

**Week:** 7
**Phase:** REBELLION
**Duration:** 7 days
**Core Theme:** Self-compassion through changing conditions

---

## Module Focus

"Always do your best" sounds simple. But what IS your best? It changes moment to moment, depending on your energy, health, circumstances, and state of mind. This agreement teaches you to give what you can in each moment—no more, no less—and to release regret, guilt, and self-judgment.

**Key Insight:** Your best is enough. Always. Even when it changes.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

1. **Understand** that "your best" is not a fixed standard—it fluctuates
2. **Recognize** when you're pushing beyond your capacity (overachievement) or holding back (self-sabotage)
3. **Practice** giving your best in each moment without attachment to outcome
4. **Develop** self-compassion when your best today is less than your best yesterday
5. **Transform** your relationship to effort, achievement, and self-worth

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Your Best Is Not Constant
Your best when you're:
- Healthy ≠ Your best when you're sick
- Rested ≠ Your best when you're exhausted
- Supported ≠ Your best when you're alone
- Confident ≠ Your best when you're grieving

Expecting yesterday's capacity today is a setup for failure.

**Question to Reflect:** Are you measuring your current best against an outdated version of yourself?

---

### 2. The Trap of Overachievement
Doing MORE than your best is not virtue—it's self-violence. When you:
- Push past exhaustion (because "I should be stronger")
- Ignore your body's limits (because "weakness is failure")
- Sacrifice yourself for approval (because "my worth = my output")

You're violating the Fourth Agreement. Your best ≠ your maximum.

**Question to Reflect:** When do you push yourself past your actual capacity? Why?

---

### 3. The Trap of Self-Sabotage
Doing LESS than your best (when you have capacity) is also a violation. This happens when:
- Fear of failure makes you quit before trying
- The Parasite says "Why bother? You'll just fail anyway."
- You hold back to avoid disappointment

Your best includes taking the risk when you can.

**Question to Reflect:** Where are you holding back from your true capacity out of fear?

---

### 4. The Liberation of Enough
When you do your best, you have no regrets. You can say:
- "I gave what I could with what I had."
- "My best was enough, even if the outcome wasn't what I wanted."
- "I honor my limits without shame."

This is freedom from the Judge. The Judge can't attack you for doing your best.

**Question to Reflect:** What would change if you truly believed your best was always enough?

---

### 5. Integration with the Other Agreements
The Fourth Agreement makes the other three sustainable:

- **Impeccable Word:** Do your best to speak truth—when you slip, forgive yourself and try again
- **Don't Take Personally:** Do your best to let go—when you absorb poison, notice and release
- **Don't Assume:** Do your best to ask—when you forget and assume, correct it without shame

"Always do your best" means: Practice the agreements to your current capacity, and be gentle with yourself when you fall short.

**Question to Reflect:** When you violate an agreement, do you judge yourself harshly, or do you say "I'll do better next time"?

## Reflection Exercises

### Exercise 1: Best vs. Maximum
**Time:** 20 minutes
**Instructions:**

Think of 3 areas of your life. For each, answer:

| **Area** | **What I Think "My Best" Means** | **Am I Pushing Past My Capacity?** | **Am I Holding Back Out of Fear?** | **What's My ACTUAL Best Right Now?** |
|----------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Example: Work | "Work 12 hours a day, never rest" | Yes—I'm exhausted | No | "Work 6 focused hours, then rest" |

**Reflection Question:** Where are you confusing "your best" with "your maximum"? Where are you not giving your full capacity?

---

### Exercise 2: The Regret Audit
**Time:** 20 minutes
**Instructions:**

List 3 things you regret (recent or past). For each, ask:

| **Regret** | **Did I Do My Best at the Time?** | **If Yes, Why the Regret?** | **If No, What Stopped Me?** |
|------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Example: Yelled at my kid | No—I reacted from exhaustion | -- | I was depleted, didn't ask for help |

**Reflection Question:** When you did your best, can you release regret? When you didn't, can you forgive yourself and commit to trying again?

---

## Integration Practice

### Daily Practice: The Best Assessment
**Time:** 5 minutes, evening
**Instructions:**

At the end of each day, reflect:

1. **What was my capacity today?** (energy, health, emotional state)
2. **Did I honor my capacity, or did I push past it / hold back?**
3. **Where did I do my best?** (Celebrate this)
4. **Where did I fall short?** (Not judgment—just noticing)
5. **What's one thing I'll do tomorrow with my best?**

**Goal:** Build awareness of your fluctuating capacity and practice self-compassion.

- **Tracking your capacity** (noting when you're depleted vs. energized)
- **Releasing regret** when you do your best (even if the outcome isn't perfect)
- **Forgiving yourself** when you slip (and recommitting without shame)

- What was my capacity today?
- Where did I do my best?
- Where did I violate this agreement (overachievement or self-sabotage)?
- What did I learn?

**Share your experience in the community forum.**

## Key Takeaways

- Your best changes moment to moment based on capacity
- Overachievement (pushing past limits) and self-sabotage (holding back from fear) both violate this agreement
- Doing your best eliminates regret (you gave what you could)
- The Fourth Agreement makes the other three sustainable (practice with self-compassion)
- Your best is enough—always

**Remember:** You'll have days when your best feels small. That's okay. What matters is that you gave what you could with what you had. That's mastery.
