# Module 5: Don't Make Assumptions

**Week:** 5
**Phase:** REBELLION
**Duration:** 7 days
**Core Theme:** Ending the stories that create unnecessary conflict

---

## Module Focus

Your mind is a story-making machine. It fills in gaps with assumptions, then treats those assumptions as facts. This creates entire false realities that generate conflict, suffering, and broken relationships. This module teaches you to ask instead of assume—and to find courage in clarity.

**Key Insight:** Most of your suffering is based on things that never actually happened—just stories you made up and believed.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

1. **Recognize** when you're making assumptions (vs. knowing facts)
2. **Understand** how assumptions create false realities that generate suffering
3. **Practice** asking questions instead of filling gaps with stories
4. **Develop** the courage to seek clarity (even when it's uncomfortable)
5. **Transform** relationships through clear communication instead of mind-reading

## Key Concepts

### 1. The Assumption Trap
Your mind hates uncertainty. So when it doesn't know something, it invents a story and treats that story as truth.

Examples:
- They didn't text back → "They're mad at me" (assumption, not fact)
- Boss gave me a look → "I'm about to be fired" (assumption, not fact)
- Partner is quiet → "They don't love me anymore" (assumption, not fact)

The assumption becomes reality in your mind—and you suffer based on fiction.

**Question to Reflect:** What's one assumption you're currently treating as truth?

---

### 2. Mind-Reading Doesn't Work
You CANNOT know what someone else is thinking or feeling unless they tell you. When you assume you know:
- You're projecting your fears/expectations onto them
- You're reacting to a story, not reality
- You're creating unnecessary conflict

Mind-reading is ego pretending to be psychic.

**Question to Reflect:** When you assume you know what someone else is thinking, how often are you wrong?

---

### 3. The Courage to Ask
Not making assumptions requires courage because:
- You have to admit you don't know
- You risk hearing something you don't want to hear
- You must make yourself vulnerable by asking

But the alternative (living in false stories) is far more painful.

**Question to Reflect:** What are you afraid to ask someone right now? What assumption are you making instead?

---

### 4. Clear Communication as Spiritual Practice
When you stop making assumptions, you must communicate clearly:
- "I don't understand. Can you explain?"
- "I'm noticing I'm making up a story. Can we talk about what's actually happening?"
- "I need clarity. Here's what I'm assuming—is that true?"

This level of honesty transforms relationships.

**Question to Reflect:** What would change in your relationships if you asked for clarity instead of assuming?

---

### 5. Assumptions as Parasite Food
The Parasite LOVES assumptions because they:
- Confirm your worst fears ("See, I knew they didn't care!")
- Justify your judgments ("I was right not to trust them.")
- Keep you safe from vulnerability (can't be hurt if you never ask)

Every assumption you make feeds the Parasite.

**Question to Reflect:** What does your Parasite gain when you assume the worst?

## Reflection Exercises

### Exercise 1: The Assumption Inventory
**Time:** 30 minutes
**Instructions:**

List 5 recent situations where you made assumptions. For each, complete:

| **Situation** | **What I Assumed** | **What I ACTUALLY Knew** (facts only) | **What Happened When I Believed the Assumption** |
|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Example: Partner was distant | "They're upset with me" | Partner was quiet. (That's it.) | I got defensive. Created a fight that wasn't necessary. |

**Reflection Question:** How much suffering was created by believing stories instead of knowing facts?

---

### Exercise 2: Fear of Asking
**Time:** 20 minutes
**Instructions:**

Think of something you're currently assuming but haven't asked about. Answer:

1. What am I assuming?
2. What am I afraid will happen if I ask?
3. What's the cost of NOT asking (continuing to assume)?
4. What would I ask if I had complete courage?
5. What's one small step toward clarity?

**Reflection Question:** Is the fear of asking greater than the pain of living in a false story?

---

## Integration Practice

### Daily Practice: The Clarity Check
**Time:** In the moment (when assumptions arise)
**Instructions:**

When you notice yourself making an assumption:

1. **Pause.** Stop before reacting to the story.
2. **Ask yourself:** "Is this true, or am I making this up?"
3. **Separate:** What do I ACTUALLY know (facts) vs. what I'm assuming (story)?
4. **Decide:** Can I ask for clarity? Should I?
5. **Act:** Either ask or consciously release the assumption.

**Goal:** Break the reflex of treating assumptions as facts. Build the courage to ask.

## Integration Challenge

### The 3-Day "Ask Instead of Assume" Challenge
**Instructions:**

For 3 days, every time you catch yourself making an assumption, STOP and ASK instead.

**Examples:**
- Instead of: "They're ignoring me" → Ask: "Hey, I noticed you didn't respond. Is everything okay?"
- Instead of: "They think I'm incompetent" → Ask: "Can you give me feedback on that project? I want to make sure I'm meeting expectations."
- Instead of: "They don't care" → Ask: "I'm feeling disconnected. Can we talk?"

**Track:**
- How many assumptions did you catch?
- How many times did you ask for clarity?
- What did you learn when you asked vs. when you assumed?

**Share your experience in the community forum.**

---

## Community Discussion Prompt

**This Week's Question:**
"Share a time when an assumption created unnecessary conflict or suffering—and what happened when you finally asked for clarity. What were you assuming? What was actually true?"

**Celebrate the courage it takes to ask instead of assume.**

### Bonus Audio:
- "The Clarity Breath" (5-min meditation) - Practice releasing assumptions
- "Ask With Courage" (3-min affirmation track)

### Journaling Prompts:
1. What's one assumption I've been living with for years? What if I finally asked?
2. When I assume the worst, what does that reveal about my own fears?
3. What would my relationships look like if I asked for clarity every time I felt uncertain?

---

## Key Takeaways

- Assumptions are stories you invent to fill gaps in information
- Mind-reading doesn't work—you cannot know what others think/feel without asking
- Most suffering is based on false realities created by assumptions
- Asking for clarity requires courage but transforms relationships
- The question "Is this true, or am I making this up?" stops suffering before it starts

**Remember:** You'll still make assumptions. The goal isn't perfection—it's catching yourself faster and choosing to ask instead. That's the practice.
