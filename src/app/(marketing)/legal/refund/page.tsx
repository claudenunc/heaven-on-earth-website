            <p className="mt-4">
              We want you to invest in THE CURE or other paid services only if they genuinely serve you. If the material doesn't resonate or help within 30 days, we'll refund your money. No questions asked.

            <h2 className="font-serif text-2xl font-bold text-navy mt-8 mb-4">1. What's Refundable</h2>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-navy mt-6 mb-3">1.1 THE CURE Course</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>$497 Tier:</strong> Full refund within 30 days of purchase</li>
              <li><strong>$2,997 Tier (Course + Coaching):</strong> Full refund within 30 days of purchase</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-4">
              <strong>Eligibility:</strong> Complete the first 3 modules. If you still feel it's not helping, you're eligible for a refund.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              <strong>Why This Requirement:</strong> We want you to genuinely engage with the material before deciding. Many insights don't click immediately - they need a few lessons to integrate. But if after 3 modules it's not resonating, we honor that.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-navy mt-6 mb-3">1.2 Future Paid Products</h3>
            <p>
              As we add new paid offerings (advanced courses, workshops, certifications), the same 30-day guarantee applies unless explicitly stated otherwise.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-navy mt-6 mb-3">1.3 What's NOT Refundable</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Free Tier Services:</strong> LIGHTHOUSE, Dream Catcher, Perfect World form (already free)</li>
              <li><strong>Coaching Sessions After Delivered:</strong> Once a 1-on-1 coaching session occurs, that specific session is non-refundable (but unused sessions in a package can be refunded)</li>
              <li><strong>Completed Workshops/Events:</strong> After an event has happened, no refund (but you can transfer to future events)</li>
              <li><strong>After 30 Days:</strong> Refund window closes 30 days from purchase date</li>

            <p>
              This isn't about protecting ourselves legally. It's about removing fear from your decision.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              We've built THE CURE and these services because we believe they work. We've seen them transform lives. But we also know: what helps one person might not resonate with another. And that's okay.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              We want you to invest in transformation, not feel trapped by a purchase. If it's not serving you, get your money back. If it is serving you but money becomes an issue, let us know. We'll figure it out.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 font-semibold">
              This mission is about love, not transactions.
