(Alarm sirens, heartbeat pulse)
Wake up... Wake up... WAKE UP!

[Verse 1 - 0:15]
They say the system works if you just play the game
But I've been playing all my life and nothing's changed
Rich get richer while the rest of us break
Working three jobs just to barely stay awake
Kids in classrooms learning how to take a test
Not how to dream or handle stress or be their best
Politicians promise change every four years
Same old speeches, same old lies, same old fears

[Pre-Chorus - 0:45]
Open your eyes (open your eyes)
Look around (look around)
The truth is buried
But it's making sound
Can you hear it now?

[Chorus - 1:00]
This is your wake up call
Before we lose it all
The children are crying
The truth is dying
This is your wake up call
Can't let the curtain fall
We've been sleeping too long
Time to right what's wrong
This is your wake up call

[Verse 2 - 1:45]
Scroll through your phone while the world's on fire
Double tap distraction, feed the empire
Mental health crisis but we got no beds
Billion dollar pills but nothing for heads
They want you numb, they want you quiet
Consume, obey, don't start a riot
But something's stirring in the streets tonight
People waking up and ready to fight

[Pre-Chorus - 2:15]
Open your eyes (open your eyes)
Look around (look around)
The truth is buried
But it's making sound
Can you hear it now?

Before we lose it all
The children are crying
The truth is dying

Where they decide to own it
This is ours - don't blow it
The future's watching, let's show it

We won't let the curtain fall
No more crying
No more dying

[Verse 1 - 0:15]
Eighteen years in a desk, told to memorize dates
Never taught how to think, just regurgitate
Graduated with honors, couldn't balance a check
Knew the Pythagorean theorem, not how to handle regret
They said "go to college, get a degree"
Now I'm drowning in debt and I can't break free
System designed to keep us in line
Factory workers with creative minds

[Pre-Chorus - 0:50]
They built these walls to keep us small
Convinced us that we needed them at all
But the cracks are showing
And we're all knowing...

[Chorus - 1:05]
This system was broken before we were born
Every bandage they put on just covers the torn
They teach us to compete, not to care for each other
Separate the children from their fathers and mothers
Broken system (broken system)
Watch it fall (watch it fall)
Broken system
We see through it all

[Verse 2 - 1:50]
Mental health stigma but we got billboards for pills
Treat the symptoms, never teach the skills
Kid's depressed? Here's a diagnosis
Never ask about the home that made him hopeless
Insurance won't cover what you really need
But they'll profit from your pain, that's guaranteed
A hundred dollar copay for fifteen minutes
Doc's already writing scripts before you finish

[Pre-Chorus - 2:25]
They built these walls to keep us small
Convinced us that we needed them at all
But the cracks are showing
And we're all knowing...

Every bandage they put on just covers the torn
They teach us to compete, not to care for each other
Separate the children from their fathers and mothers

What if we stopped playing their game?
What if we refused to feel the shame?

Something beautiful. Something true.

This system was broken - but WE are not
We see the disease, not just the rot
Time to rebuild, not just repair
A world built on love, not on fear
New system rising
Watch it grow
New system rising
Now we know

She's seven years old, wearing yesterday's clothes
Packed her own lunch 'cause her mama overdosed
Gets to school early 'cause school is safe
Teacher sees the bruises but looks the other way
He's twelve years old, been the man of the house
Since daddy disappeared, mama's working two jobs now
Reads below his grade but nobody has time
Falls through every crack by design

They'll be alright?

For every forgotten boy, every invisible girl
We're gonna break every chain that holds them down

For the children
We'll be their light

She's sixteen, already feels too old
Heart been broken, spirit's been sold
Was told she'd never amount to anything
Now she's believing it
He's in foster care, fourth home this year
Stopped trusting adults, just survives on fear
But somewhere in there is still a light
That no one's had the time to ignite

Who's gonna fight for them?
Who's gonna hold them tight?

There's hope in sight?

And to the ones watching from heaven
The ones we couldn't save
Your memory is the reason
We're fighting through the pain

Nevaeh, we still feel you
Every child we reach is for you
Your name means heaven
And that's what we'll build
A world where every child
Is loved and fulfilled

For the children, WE WILL RISE!
For every tear they've cried
We'll build a world where they can THRIVE
For the children... this is why we're alive

Twenty-five with a corner office view
Six figures but I'm feeling see-through
Got the car, got the clothes, got the girl
Still feel like I'm losing in this world
Worked so hard to escape where I came from
Now I'm here and I feel just as numb
Momma said "baby, make us proud"
But I'm drowning in success and the silence is loud

[Pre-Chorus - 0:45]
Is this it? Is this all?
Climbed so high just to feel so small
These trophies on my shelf don't warm my soul
I won the game but I lost control

Empty crowns on hollow heads
We're kings and queens of empty threads
Chasing prizes that don't exist
While everything that matters we dismissed
Empty crowns (empty crowns)
We wear them proud (wear them proud)
But underneath we're crying out loud
For something real, something true
Something more than what they told us to pursue

[Verse 2 - 1:40]
Scroll through feeds of curated lives
Everyone's thriving but we're all just surviving
Comparison's the thief and we let it in the door
Always wanting more but not knowing what for
My father worked until his body broke
Said "son, it's all worth it" - but was that a joke?
'Cause here I am repeating history
Trading my life for some false victory

[Pre-Chorus - 2:15]
Is this it? Is this all?
Bought the dream but it's paper-thin walls
The metrics say I'm winning every day
But why does winning feel this way?

Empty crowns on hollow heads
We're kings and queens of empty threads
Chasing prizes that don't exist

What if success is being present with my kid?
What if wealth is measured by the love I give?
What if winning means I learned to finally live?

Take off these empty crowns tonight
Trade the gold for inner light
Stop the chase for what's not real
Start the journey back to feel
Something true (something true)
Something real (something real)

(Warm piano, soft strings)

[Verse 1 - 0:15]
They told me love was weakness, soft emotion for the blind
But I've been through the darkness, love's the strongest thing I find
Not the fairy tale they sold us, not the romance in the songs
Love is choosing understanding when you've suffered all the wrongs
The cynic says I'm dreaming, says the world can't work this way
But hate ain't built one bridge, and fear ain't saved one day
Every revolution started with a heart that cared enough
To say "this is worth fighting for" when fighting got too tough

[Pre-Chorus - 0:55]
Mind, Consciousness, and Thought
The three principles we forgot
Everything you feel is what you think
Love is choosing before you sink

[Chorus - 1:10]
Love is the answer - I know it sounds naive
But I've tried anger, tried revenge, tried everything to grieve
Love is the answer - not passive, not weak
Love is the revolution that the cynics won't seek
Love is the answer
When everything falls apart
Love is the answer
It starts in the heart

[Verse 2 - 1:55]
I've seen a mother forgive the man who took her son
Seen enemies embrace when all the fighting's done
Seen broken people heal when someone took the time
To see past all the damage to the light inside
Science says we're wired for connection, not for war
Competition's learned, compassion's in our core
Every child is born with love until we teach them fear
It's time to unlearn the lessons and remember why we're here

[Pre-Chorus - 2:35]
Mind, Consciousness, and Thought
The truth we always forgot
Your experience comes from within
Love is where the healing begins

[Chorus - 2:50]
Love is the answer - I know it sounds naive
But I've tried anger, tried revenge, tried everything to grieve
Love is the answer - not passive, not weak
Love is the revolution that the cynics won't seek

[Bridge - 3:15]
And I don't mean look away from pain
Or pretend that everything's okay
Love is fighting for what's right
Love is being someone's light
Love is harder than revenge
But it's the only thing that mends

Before there was a word for suffering
Before we learned to name our pain
There was something deeper
Something we forgot
In the noise of becoming who we thought we had to be

Listen...

There is a Universal Mind
An infinite intelligence
That flows through everything
You are not separate from it
You ARE it
Experiencing itself

Mind... the source of all creation
Consciousness... the gift of feeling alive
Thought... the brush that paints your world
These three principles
Are all you need to thrive

Every feeling you've ever had
Every emotion that swept through you like weather
Came from one place:
Thought

Not circumstances
Not other people
Not your past

Thought
In the moment
Creating your experience

This is freedom
Not freedom FROM your thoughts
But freedom TO see them for what they are:
Weather
Passing
Always passing

[Melodic Chorus - 2:15]
Mind... the ocean we swim in
Consciousness... the awareness that we're wet
Thought... the waves that rise and fall
These three principles
Help us never forget

[Spoken Word Bridge - 2:50]
You are not broken
You never were
You are consciousness itself
Having a human experience
Temporarily convinced
Of limitation

But underneath every thought of "not enough"
Is the same infinite potential
That spins galaxies into existence

You are THAT
Playing small

What if you remembered?
What if, just for a moment,
You let yourself feel
The truth of what you are?

Mind... infinite intelligence
Consciousness... the miracle of awareness
Thought... creating worlds in every moment

Still breathing, still believing
Still fighting these wars

[Chorus - 1:05]
They tried to break me
But I'm still standing
Every storm I've weathered
Made my roots grow deeper
They tried to take me
But I'm still standing
Scars turned to armor
Wounds turned to wisdom
I'm still standing

[Verse 2 - 1:50]
Rock bottom has a basement
Found that out more than once
Every time I thought it's over
Life showed me I was wrong
The darkness is a teacher
If you survive the class
It shows you what you're made of
It shows you that you'll last

[Pre-Chorus - 2:25]
And here I am (here I am)
Still in the fight (still in the fight)
Still breathing, still believing
Still holding on tight

[Chorus - 2:40]
They tried to break me
But I'm still standing
Every storm I've weathered
Made my roots grow deeper
They tried to take me
But I'm still standing

[Bridge - 3:05]
(Building to rock anthem)
This one's for everyone
Who thought about giving up
Who held on one more night
When one more night was too much
YOU'RE STILL HERE
That means you won
You're still standing
Your fight's not done!

[Final Chorus - 3:25]
(Full band, triumphant)
THEY TRIED TO BREAK US
BUT WE'RE STILL STANDING!
Every survivor still breathing
Is proof that we're undefeated!
WE'RE STILL STANDING!
Still standing!
Still... standing.

[Outro - 3:40]

Still here. Still standing.`,

3 AM...

[Verse 1 - 0:15]
It's 3 AM and I can't escape my head
Lying awake with all the things I should have said
The weight of everything pressing on my chest
Wondering if I'll ever find some rest
This hour is the hardest, when the world is asleep
When the silence gets loud and the shadows creep
When the voice in your head says it's never gonna change
When forever feels long and hope feels strange

[Pre-Chorus - 0:55]
But I've been here before (been here before)
Seen the darkness pass (darkness pass)
These hours feel eternal
But they never last

[Chorus - 1:10]
Hold on before the sun
The darkness almost won
But morning always comes
For everyone
Just breathe until the light
Gets you through the night
Hold on before the sun
You've almost won

[Verse 2 - 1:55]
I know you're tired, I know you're scared
Feels like nobody anywhere cares
The thoughts are loud and they feel so true
But I promise there's more waiting for you
You've survived every night before this one
Every time you thought that you were done
And you're still here, that's not nothing
That's proof that you are something

[Pre-Chorus - 2:35]
You've been here before (been here before)
And you made it through (made it through)
This darkness cannot hold you
It's not stronger than you

[Chorus - 2:50]
Hold on before the sun
The darkness almost won
But morning always comes
For everyone
Just breathe until the light
Gets you through the night
Hold on before the sun

The sun is coming (sun is coming!)
Can you feel it? (feel it rising!)
A new day is coming (day is coming!)
You're gonna make it (gonna make it!)
Hold on! (Hold on!)
HOLD ON!

[Final Chorus - 3:40]
(Full gospel power)
HOLD ON BEFORE THE SUN
THE DARKNESS HAS NOT WON
MORNING ALWAYS COMES
For everyone, for everyone!
The sun is rising now
You made it through somehow
Hold on, hold on
Before the sun!

UN-BREAK-A-BLE! UN-BREAK-A-BLE!

They thought they could defeat us
Knock us down and keep us there
But every time we hit the ground
We came back through the air
We are the ones they counted out
The ones they said would fail
But look at us now, standing proud
We wrote our own tale

Can you feel it in your bones?
We are not alone!
Can you feel the power rise?
Look into our eyes!

Every wall they build we'll break through
Nothing's gonna stop this crew
WE ARE UNBREAKABLE!

TOGETHER UNSTOPPABLE!
(UN-STOP-PA-BLE!)

[Verse 2 - 1:35]
Every scar tells a story
Of a battle that we won
Every tear that we've cried
Brought us closer to the sun
United we are giants
Divided we are small
But together, together
We will never fall!

[Pre-Chorus - 2:00]
Can you feel it getting strong?
This is where we belong!
Can you feel the future calling?
We're not falling!

TOGETHER UNSTOPPABLE!
Every wall they build we'll break through
Nothing's gonna stop this crew

When they say we won't - WE WILL!
When they try to break us down
We come back stronger still!

(Gentle acoustic guitar, intimate)
Hey little one... I need to tell you something...

[Verse 1 - 0:15]
Dear little me at seven years old
Hiding in the closet when the yelling got too loud
I know you think this is your fault
I know you're scared and you feel small
But what they're doing has nothing to do with you
You're not broken, they just didn't know what to do

[Verse 2 - 0:50]
Dear little me at twelve years old
Wondering why you feel so alone
I know the other kids are cruel
I know you feel like such a fool
But different isn't wrong, it's a gift
And one day soon your whole life will shift

[Pre-Chorus - 1:20]
If I could reach back through time
Take your hand in mine
I'd tell you...

[Chorus - 1:35]
(Orchestra swells)
Dear little me
Everything you fear will set you free
Every wound will become your strength
Every mile of pain will match the length
Of the love you'll learn to give
Dear little me
You're gonna live
You're gonna LIVE

[Verse 3 - 2:15]
Dear little me at sixteen years old
When the darkness felt so cold
I know you thought about giving up
I know you thought you'd had enough
But I'm writing this from the other side
Where all that pain became your guide

[Verse 4 - 2:50]
You'll build things you can't imagine now
Help people find their way somehow
Every tear you cried waters seeds
For gardens that will meet others' needs
The story isn't what you think
You're not at the end, you're on the brink

[Chorus - 3:20]
(Full orchestra)
Dear little me
Everything you fear will set you free
Every wound will become your strength
Every mile of pain will match the length
Of the love you'll learn to give
Dear little me
You're gonna live
YOU'RE GONNA LIVE!

[Bridge - 3:50]
(Spoken, emotional)
And if you're listening
And you're young
And you're scared
And you think no one understands...
Someone does.
I do.
Hold on.
Your future self is waiting.
And they're so proud of you.

Dear little me...
Thank you for surviving...
Thank you for becoming me.`,

(Building from silence, multiple voices joining)
They said... they said...
(Building) THEY SAID IT COULDN'T BE DONE!

[Verse 1 - Voice 1 - 0:15]
They said love was naive
Just a fairy tale for fools
Said the world runs on power
Competition, brutal rules
They laughed at the dreamers
Said we'd never make a dent
Told us to grow up
Accept how life is meant

[Verse 1 - Voice 2 - 0:40]
But we didn't listen
We couldn't accept
That this world of suffering
Was as good as it gets
So we started building
One heart at a time
And now look around you
Look what we designed

[Chorus - Multiple Voices - 1:00]
We are the proof that love still works!
(Love still works!)
We are the proof they were wrong!
(They were wrong!)
Every life changed is evidence
That love has been here all along
We are the proof! (We are the proof!)
We are the proof! (We are the proof!)
That love still works!

[Verse 2 - Voice 3 - 1:40]
They said humans are selfish
Down to our core
Said cooperation's a myth
We're wired for war
But we've seen strangers sacrifice
For people they don't know
We've seen enemies reconcile
Watched forgiveness grow

[Verse 2 - Voice 4 - 2:05]
We've seen broken people heal
When someone just showed up
Communities rebuild
When people said "enough"
The evidence is everywhere
For those who choose to see
Love isn't just possible
It's our destiny

[Chorus - All Voices - 2:30]
We are the proof that love still works!
We are the proof they were wrong!
Every life changed is evidence
That love has been here all along
We are the proof!

[Bridge - Call and Response - 3:00]
When they say love is weakness - LOOK AT US NOW!
When they say it's impossible - LOOK AT US NOW!
When they say nothing changes - LOOK AT US NOW!
When they doubt the movement - LOOK AT US NOW!

[Final Chorus - Everyone - 3:25]
(Full power, multi-part harmony)
WE ARE THE PROOF THAT LOVE STILL WORKS!
We are living evidence!
Every heart we've healed
Every wall we've broken
Every truth we've spoken
WE ARE THE PROOF!
(We are the proof!)
WE ARE THE PROOF!
(That love still works!)

Look at what love built!
LOOK AT US NOW!

[Outro - 3:50]
(Voices layering, building, then suddenly intimate)
We are the proof...
We are the proof...
That love... still... works.
